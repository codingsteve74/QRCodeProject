## Overview

The QR Code 

this is a simple HTML and CSS project designing and developing this mobile first then modifying the project to conform 
to fullscreen-desktop settings. THe project QR Code does work as it has been tested with mobile QR scanners that does load
to the website of frontendmentor.io 

The QR code project did and still does both work in both the mobile version as well as the fullscreen-desktop screen sizes.

## My Process

The process of the projects development was based on as previously mentioned. Took the mobile first approach via using HTML and CSS
The idea here was to plan out the project on paper and then from there start to code out the divs/containers to set up the canvas area 
for viewing. 

Once the the layout and canvas area was all done moved to the CSS portion of the mobile version. As this project was and is not that complex 
the CSS was not complicated to make up. Once that is done, then had the media queery set up for the desktop version and made some small changes 
that needed to be adjusted to desktop version

### Built with 

The whole project was built with Microsoft Viaual Code only using HTML and CSS
